%
% DESCRIPTION:
%
% This code processes a binary matrix X by performing logical negation,
% then identifies and transforms blocks of consecutive values. The transformed 
% matrix Z is generated where the end of each zero-block is replaced with 
% the negative length of the preceding one-block. Finally, the code computes 
% the matrix ZX by element-wise multiplying X with the cumulative sum of Z.
%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% INPUTS:
%
% X:     A binary matrix where each element is either 0 or
%        (n√óm, where n is the number of observations, and m 
%        is the number of variables)
%
%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% OUTPUT:
%
% ZX:  A matrix resulting from the element-wise multiplication 
%      of the original matrix X with the cumulative sum of matrix Z.
